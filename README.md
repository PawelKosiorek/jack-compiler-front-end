### Jack Compiler front end

Jack is a modern, Java-like, high level object oriented language. It was created for the purposes of nand2tetris course and is run on the Hack Computer hardware platform. This software is the front-end part of Jack compiler. Jack compiler consists of back and front end because it is a two-tier one. The front-end part compiles Jack classes into intermadiate code called VM (similar to JVM) whereas the back-end part compiles VM files into a single Hack assembly file, runnable on the Hack platform.
